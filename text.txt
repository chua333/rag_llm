Introduced in September 2023, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are two of Apple's current flagship iPhones, sold alongside the higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The new iPhones launched in September 2023, and they are about halfway through their product cycle. It is still a good time to buy an iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus, and new models won't come out until September 2024.

As the latest models, the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus will last for many years to come and will remain part of Apple's flagship lineup until September 2024, so you can rest assured that something newer and better is not right around the corner.
